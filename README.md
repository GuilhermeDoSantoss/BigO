## 📊 Big-O Analysis: HashMap vs ArrayList in Java


This project demonstrates and analyzes the performance differences between two commonly used Java data structures: HashMap and ArrayList, under the lens of Big-O notation. The goal is to provide a practical, measurable comparison showing why HashMap can be significantly more efficient than ArrayList in specific scenarios, especially when it comes to lookup operations.


## 🔍 What is Big-O?

Big-O notation describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to its input size. It allows developers to estimate the performance and scalability of data structures and algorithms.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

Big-O	Name	Description
O(1)	Constant time	Execution time remains the same regardless of input size

O(n)	Linear time	Execution time grows proportionally to input size

O(n²)	Quadratic time	Execution time grows quadratically (nested loops)

O(log n)	Logarithmic time	Efficient operations that reduce input space (e.g., binary search)


## 🧪 Experiment Summary

This project benchmarks the performance of HashMap and ArrayList for lookup operations (i.e., retrieving an element based on a key or value).

Scenario:
You need to retrieve data (e.g., search for a user by ID or name).

Input size is large (e.g., 100,000+ entries).

Operation is repeated multiple times.


## 🚀 Execution and Results

Insert 100,000 elements in both ArrayList and HashMap

Retrieve a specific element 10,000 times

Big-O Analysis
Operation	ArrayList	HashMap
Insertion	O(1) (amortized)	O(1)
Lookup by value	O(n)	O(1)
Removal	O(n)	O(1)
Iteration	O(n)	O(n)

Runtime Results (example):

Searching in ArrayList took: 743ms

Searching in HashMap took: 1ms

✅ HashMap outperforms ArrayList significantly for lookup operations due to its constant time complexity (O(1)) compared to the linear time (O(n)) of ArrayList.

## 🧠 Why HashMap is More Efficient

HashMap uses a hashing mechanism to map keys to values, enabling fast direct access.

ArrayList requires linear iteration to search for an element, especially when the index is unknown.

For read-heavy operations, especially when dealing with key-based retrieval, HashMap provides superior performance.

## 📌 When to Use Each

Use Case	Recommended Structure

Fast lookup by key	HashMap

Ordered list of elements	ArrayList

Frequent search by index	ArrayList

Associative data (key-value)	HashMap

Memory-efficient sequential list	ArrayList

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java 17+


Data Structures: java.util.HashMap, java.util.ArrayList

## 📈 Conclusion

This project provides a clear, data-backed comparison between HashMap and ArrayList, emphasizing that choosing the right data structure based on time complexity is crucial for application performance.

✅ Use HashMap when you require fast access by key.

⚠️ Avoid ArrayList for frequent lookups unless the index is known.
